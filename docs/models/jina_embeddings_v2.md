# Serving jina-embeddings-v2 (JinaBert) on TPU

Runbook for bringing up `jinaai/jina-embeddings-v2-small-en` — a JAX-native
encoder-only embedding model (symmetric ALiBi, GEGLU, post-LayerNorm) — on a
fresh TPU VM (validated on v6e, TP=1, full 8192-token context). The model
runs under vLLM's pooling runner with no KV cache; mean pooling executes in
vLLM's CPU pooler. The symmetric ALiBi bias is computed inside the
flash-attention kernel (`docs/developer_guides/encoder_alibi_kernel.md`), so
long context costs no extra HBM.

## 1. Code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shivajid/tpu-inference.git
cd tpu-inference
git checkout jina-v2-alibi-kernel
```

## 2. Python environment (uv, python 3.12)

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh && source ~/.bashrc
uv venv ~/vllm-env --python 3.12 --seed    # --seed installs pip into the venv
source ~/vllm-env/bin/activate
```

## 3. Install vLLM TPU stack, then overlay the repo editable

```bash
python -m pip install vllm-tpu==0.26.0           # version this runbook was validated against
python -m pip install -e .                       # CRITICAL — see below
python -m pip install onnxruntime transformers   # for the parity test
```

(Validated environment: `vllm-tpu 0.26.0`, `jax/jaxlib 0.11.0`,
`libtpu 0.0.44`, python 3.12.)

The editable install is **required**: `vllm serve` spawns API-server and
engine subprocesses that import `tpu_inference` from site-packages, not from
your checkout. Without `-e .` those processes silently run the stale bundled
copy. Verify (must print the repo path, not site-packages):

```bash
cd ~ && python -c 'import tpu_inference, os; print(os.path.dirname(tpu_inference.__file__))'
cd ~/tpu-inference
```

## 4. Environment patches (one shot, idempotent)

```bash
python scripts/setup_jina_env.py
export HF_TOKEN=<your-token>   # optional; avoids HF rate limits
```

The script applies three patches to the active environment (see its
docstring for details): `transformers.onnx` and `transformers.pytorch_utils`
stubs for APIs removed in transformers v5 but still imported (never executed
at inference) by the Jina remote-code config, and a `sitecustomize.py` hook
that registers the JinaBert architectures with vLLM's ModelRegistry in every
process — needed because the API-server process validates ModelConfig before
`vllm.general_plugins` load or `tpu_inference` is imported.

## 5. Validate

```bash
pytest tests/kernels/encoder_alibi_kernel_test.py -v  # ALiBi kernel vs dense reference; expect 5 passed
pytest tests/models/jax/test_jina_bert.py -v -rs   # parity vs official ONNX export; expect 3 passed
pytest tests/e2e/test_jina_embeddings.py -v -rs    # full engine path
```

The parity test compares per-token hidden states and mean-pooled embeddings
against the model repo's official ONNX export (same weights, float32, no
remote code) and requires cosine similarity > 0.999.

## 6. Serve

```bash
vllm serve jinaai/jina-embeddings-v2-small-en --runner pooling --convert embed \
  --trust-remote-code --max-model-len 8192 --max-num-batched-tokens 8192 \
  --dtype float32
```

`--max-num-batched-tokens` must be >= `max_model_len` and is **required**
for prompts longer than the 2048 default. Two reasons: (1) pooling models
cannot chunk prefill — an encoder has no KV cache and every token attends to
the full sequence in a single pass, so the whole prompt must fit in one
scheduling step's token budget; (2) the runner derives its precompiled shape
buckets from this value, so shapes above it are never compiled. Setting both
flags to 8192 also lets several short requests batch into one forward pass
(e.g. four 2000-token documents in a single step), which is the main
embedding-throughput lever.

`--convert embed` is required: vLLM classifies the `JinaBertForMaskedLM`
architecture string as masked-LM and gates the embeddings API otherwise. No
pooler flag is needed — vLLM auto-detects mean pooling from the repo's
sentence-transformers configuration.

Query:

```bash
curl localhost:8000/v1/embeddings -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"model": "jinaai/jina-embeddings-v2-small-en", "input": "How is the weather today?"}'
```

Expect a 512-dimensional embedding.

Long-context smoke test (~6300 tokens, exercises the >2048 path):

```bash
python3 - <<'PY'
import json, urllib.request
text = "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog " * 700
req = urllib.request.Request(
    "http://localhost:8000/v1/embeddings",
    json.dumps({"model": "jinaai/jina-embeddings-v2-small-en",
                "input": text}).encode(),
    {"Content-Type": "application/json"})
r = json.load(urllib.request.urlopen(req))
print("dims:", len(r["data"][0]["embedding"]), "| usage:", r["usage"])
PY
```

## Known limitations / follow-ups

- Full 8192 context supported (validated on v6e): the symmetric ALiBi bias
  is computed inside the flash-attention kernel per tile from the
  [num_heads] slopes — no O(heads × T²) tensor is materialized. Design and
  validation methodology:
  `docs/developer_guides/encoder_alibi_kernel.md`; kernel tests:
  `tests/kernels/encoder_alibi_kernel_test.py`.
- float32 only (validated); bf16 pending validation against the fp32 baseline.
- TP=1 (model is ~33M params); slopes already shard with heads for TP > 1.
- The sitecustomize hook is a workaround; an upstream vLLM registration hook
  in the API-server process would remove it.
